üìä FFT Signal Analysis and Simulation Projects


This repository contains a set of three projects developed as part of a university case study assignment (Open University MST374 ‚Äì Computational Applied Mathematics). Each project demonstrates the application of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in signal processing and mathematical modelling using Python. It includes three key components:

Tools: numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, numerical integration, signal processing

üìÅ Part 1: Fourier Transform of a Periodic Function (cosh)



This project analyses the Fourier Transform of a function, in this case the hyperbolic cosine function cosh(x), into  into a periodic function over a domain . Then applies FFT to approximate and analyze its frequency components.
The objective is to explore periodic extension and frequency representation of smooth functions.



üìÅ Part 2: Guitar Chord Frequency Analysis with FFT


Processes real guitar sound wave samples to identify fundamental frequencies and chord structures using FFT.
The objective is to detect musical notes and harmonics.




üìÅ Part 3: Stochastic Resonance in a Bistable System


Description

Simulates a bistable potential system under varying noise strengths. The Stochastic differential equation is solved by using the Euler-Maruyama method. FFT is used to analyze how signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) changes with noise amplitude ‚Äî a demonstration of stochastic resonance.
The objective is to ivestigate signal amplification due to noise in nonlinear systems.
