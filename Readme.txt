📊 FFT Signal Analysis and Simulation Projects


This repository contains a set of three projects developed as part of a university case study assignment (Open University MST374 – Computational Applied Mathematics). Each project demonstrates the application of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in signal processing and mathematical modelling using Python. It includes three key components:

Tools: numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, numerical integration, signal processing

📁 Part 1: Fourier Transform of a Periodic Function (cosh)



This project analyses the Fourier Transform of a function, in this case the hyperbolic cosine function cosh(x), into  into a periodic function over a domain . Then applies FFT to approximate and analyze its frequency components.
The objective is to explore periodic extension and frequency representation of smooth functions.



📁 Part 2: Guitar Chord Frequency Analysis with FFT


Processes real guitar sound wave samples to identify fundamental frequencies and chord structures using FFT.
The objective is to detect musical notes and harmonics.




📁 Part 3: Stochastic Resonance in a Bistable System


Description

Simulates a bistable potential system under varying noise strengths. The Stochastic differential equation is solved by using the Euler-Maruyama method. FFT is used to analyze how signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) changes with noise amplitude — a demonstration of stochastic resonance.
The objective is to ivestigate signal amplification due to noise in nonlinear systems.
